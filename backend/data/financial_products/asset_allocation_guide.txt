## Rebalancing Strategy

**Why Rebalance**: Market movements change your allocation
**When**: Annually or when allocation drifts 5%+ from target
**How**: Sell overweight assets, buy underweight assets
**Tax Consideration**: Rebalance in tax-advantaged accounts when possible

---

## The 100-Age Rule (Simple Guideline)
**Formula**: Stock Allocation = 110 - Your Age

Examples:
- Age 30: 110 - 30 = 80% stocks
- Age 50: 110 - 50 = 60% stocks
- Age 70: 110 - 70 = 40% stocks

**Modern Adjustment**: Some use 120-Age due to longer lifespans
